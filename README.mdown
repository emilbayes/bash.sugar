## Installation

If you want to follow along from your Sugar directory:

    ESPRESSO_DIR="`osascript -e 'POSIX path of (path to application support from user domain)'`/Espresso"
    mkdir -p "${ESPRESSO_DIR}/Sugars"
    git clone git://github.com/mkhl/bash.sugar.git "${ESPRESSO_DIR}/Sugars/Bash.sugar"

Otherwise, just double-click or `open` the directory containing this file
(which _must_ have a `.sugar` extension) and Espresso will take care of
installing it for you.
